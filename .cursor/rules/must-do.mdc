These are the basic rules for this project.

- This project is written in Laravel 12, so use the laravel-12-documentation provided for reference.
- I am using react next, which is bundled in Laravel 12 to display the frontend.
- Always write the database queries using eloquent, so we can migrate to MySQL for production, as development is in SQLite.
- Always show and explain a code you want to write, and request if I agree before you add in Editor.
